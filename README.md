Swift
=====

This is the repo where I will upload my learning notes for [swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) (a new programming language created by Apple). 
This repo contains a palyground project, a text version of my notes, and a swift version of my notes. 

If you know any of the following, Swift should not be hard for you:

- Python 
  - no semi-colons required
  - no main function required)

- Java 
  - automatic reference counting, similar to garbage collector in Java

- C/Objective-c/cocoa touch, etc. 
  - Swift is nuild on C and Objective-C

===

To *interact* with the codes in my notes, you need to have the follwing **in the correct order**: 

- An [Apple developer acount](https://developer.apple.com) (last time a checked, you don't need to enroll in any program)

- a Machine that runs [OS X 10.10](https://developer.apple.com/osx/whats-new/) (there is only a beta version right now, but it is free for download if you are a developer).

- [Xcode 6](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (again, there is only a beta version, and also free for developers).

##Copy Rights##
***

Most of the comments as well as the codes are direct quotes from the book [Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11).
This book is free and is available through iBooks Store. And it is the official book for learning Swift.
If you really want to learn Swift, this book is a "must-have".

I do not own the materials in my notes, if you want to use the codes in my notes, 
please refer to the book mentioned above.

##Usage##
***

Just go to the `file` manu and `import` the playground project into your Xcode and open the project.

You will see the codes in the right half of the screen, and the output in the left half.
